## Rockfall Risk Prediction Platform (Software-First, SIH-Ready)

A scalable, software-first system to predict and visualize rockfall risks in open‑pit mines using multi‑modal AI, physics-informed modeling, uncertainty-aware forecasting, and a practical operations dashboard. The approach minimizes hardware dependence, leverages low-cost/existing data sources, and emphasizes explainability, active learning, and rapid deployment.

---

### 1) Problem Understanding and Goals

- **Objective**: Predict probability and severity of rockfall events in space and time; deliver real-time risk maps, forecasts (hours–days), alerts, and action recommendations.
- **Constraints**: Limited custom hardware, variable data quality, need for fast rollout, cost sensitivity.
- **Success**: High precision for high-risk zones, early warning lead time, interpretable outputs, scalable to multiple sites.

---

### 2) Key Innovations (to stand out)

- **Multi‑Modal Foundation Layer**: Self‑supervised pretraining on DEM tiles, ortho/drone imagery, and geotech time series to learn shared terrain–texture–stress representations (contrastive learning, masked modeling).
- **Physics‑Informed ML**: Embed simplified rockfall mechanics and slope stability heuristics (e.g., factor-of-safety proxies, slope angle, roughness, discontinuity orientation) into features and loss constraints.
- **Graph Slope Model (GNN + Temporal)**: Represent benches/faces as a graph (nodes = slope segments; edges = structural adjacency). Fuse temporal sensors with spatial context using GNN + TCN/Transformer for spatio‑temporal risk.
- **Uncertainty & Explanations**: Calibrated probabilities, spatial confidence bands, and SHAP-based feature attributions per tile/segment to justify alerts to planners.
- **Synthetic Data Engine**: Procedural terrain + rainfall/vibration scenarios to generate labeled near‑miss and event data; domain randomization to improve robustness where real labels are scarce.
- **Digital Twin Lite**: Lightweight, data-driven twin of pit geometry and geotech state to simulate "what-if" scenarios and test planned blasts or rainfall extremes.
- **Human‑in‑the‑Loop Active Learning**: Label few uncertain regions weekly via planner reviews to rapidly improve model with minimal effort.
- **On‑Prem Friendly, Cloud‑Optional**: Modular microservices, runs on a single GPU or CPU cluster; optional cloud burst for training.

### 3) Data Inputs and Schemas

- **DEM**: GeoTIFF/Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF; tiled at 5–10 m; metadata: CRS, acquisition time.
- **Drone/Ortho Imagery**: RGB/Multispectral GeoTIFF/COG; mosaicked and aligned to DEM.
- **Geotechnical Sensors**: Displacement, strain, pore pressure, prism targets, extensometers; time‑stamped; per location with coordinates.
- **Environmental**: Rainfall, temperature, microseismic/vibration, wind; time series with station metadata.
- **Events/Labels**: Historical rockfalls (polygon/points, time), severity, cause, impacts; near‑miss reports.

Data contracts (proposed):

- Raster tiling grid: 256×256 px tiles with 20–40% overlap; store tile_id, x/y index, timestamp.
- Vector layers: `segments` (id, geometry, slope, aspect, rock type), `structures` (joints/faults), `events` (id, geometry, time, class, severity).
- Time series: long format `[timestamp, sensor_id, variable, value, quality_flag, segment_id?]`.

### 4) Feature Engineering (examples)

- **Terrain**: slope, aspect, curvature, roughness, TPI, TRI, relief, concavity.
- **Imagery**: texture (GLCM), edges, vegetation indices (NDVI), moisture proxies (NDWI), change detection (delta features between dates).
- **Geotech**: moving averages, trends, accelerations, exceedance counts, rain‑normalized responses, pore pressure anomalies.
- **Environmental**: rolling rainfall totals (1h/3h/24h), antecedent wetness index, temperature cycles, vibration energy.
- **Physics**: heuristic factor‑of‑safety proxy, kinematic feasibility indices (daylight, wedge/planar toppling indicators from structure orientation if available).

---

### 5) Modeling Approach

- **Stage A: Pretraining**
  - Self‑supervised contrastive learning between DEM tiles and co‑registered imagery.
  - Masked autoencoding on imagery/DEM to learn spatial priors.
- **Stage B: Spatio‑Temporal Risk Model**
  - Node representations: segment‑level embeddings from fused tile features.
  - Temporal encoder: TCN or Transformer on multi-sensor, multi-weather streams.
  - Spatial encoder: GraphSAGE/GCN to propagate neighborhood effects.
  - Output: probability of rockfall within time horizons (e.g., 6h/24h/72h) + severity class.
- **Uncertainty**: MC Dropout/Deep Ensembles; temperature scaling for calibration.
- **Explainability**: SHAP/Integrated Gradients; per‑segment top features; saliency maps for imagery.

---

### 6) System Architecture (Software‑First)

- **Ingestion**: Kafka (or lightweight Redis Streams) for streaming sensors; batch loaders for rasters and weather.
- **Processing**: Raster tiling, alignment, reprojection; vector joins; time‑series resampling.
- **Storage**: PostGIS for vectors/metadata; MinIO/S3 for rasters/models; TimescaleDB for sensor data.
- **Model Serving**: FastAPI service with TorchScript/ONNX model; Redis for feature cache; optional Triton for GPU.
- **Orchestration**: Prefect/Temporal for pipelines and retraining schedules.
- **Dashboard**: Web app (Next.js/React) + Mapbox/Deck.gl; hit PostGIS via API; live risk layers; alert center.
- **Alerts**: Rule engine (simple policy + MLOps) -> email/SMS (Twilio/SendGrid) + webhook (MS Teams/Slack).

### 17) Risks and Mitigations

- Sparse labels → use synthetic data + self‑supervised + active learning.
- Data misalignment → strict STAC metadata, automated QA checks.
